# MijnLoon

Simple program to scrape your schedule from JouwLoon once an hour and export it to an ICS file.

We also have custom events, i.e. a way to keep track of extra shifts (press 'n' and 'r' to add and remove events, respectively).

To import the result to your calendar of choice, choose a file name while running the program and make that accessible via a URL.
